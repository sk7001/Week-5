## Overview
This week was dedicated to mastering file input/output (IO) operations, processing and generating data in CSV and JSON formats, and leveraging Java's meta-programming features with annotations and reflection. We also touched on software design principles to write cleaner and more maintainable code.

## Topics Covered

### Day 1: CSV Data Handling
- Reading and writing CSV files in Java
- Parsing CSV data into Java objects
- Data validation and transformation

### Day 2: JSON Data Handling
- Introduction to JSON format
- Reading and writing JSON files
- Converting between Java objects and JSON
- Using JSON libraries (e.g., org.json)

### Day 3: Annotations
- Built-in annotations (@Override, @Deprecated, @SuppressWarnings)
- Creating and using custom annotations
- Annotation processing at runtime

### Day 4: Reflection
- Introduction to reflection API
- Inspecting classes, methods, and fields at runtime
- Dynamic object creation and method invocation
- Reflection use-cases in frameworks and tools

### Day 5: Design Principles
- SOLID principles
- Clean code practices
- Applying design principles in Java projects

## How to Use This Repository
