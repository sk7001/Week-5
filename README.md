## Overview
This week was dedicated to mastering file input/output (IO) operations, processing and generating data in CSV and JSON formats, and leveraging Java's meta-programming features with annotations and reflection.

## Topics Covered

### Day 1: CSV Data Handling
- Reading and writing CSV files in Java
- Parsing CSV data into Java objects
- Data validation and transformation

### Day 2: JSON Data Handling
- Introduction to JSON format
- Reading and writing JSON files
- Converting between Java objects and JSON
- Using JSON libraries (e.g., org.json)

### Day 3: Annotations & Reflection
- Built-in annotations (@Override, @Deprecated, @SuppressWarnings)
- Creating and using custom annotations
- Annotation processing at runtime
- Introduction to reflection API
- Inspecting classes, methods, and fields at runtime
- Dynamic object creation and method invocation
- Reflection use-cases in frameworks and tools
